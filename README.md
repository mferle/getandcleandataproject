Course project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course

There is just one script that does all the processing for the course project.

The script is named run_analysis.R. It assumes that the data is in the current working directory. The resulting tidy dataset is also written to the current working directory.

Details about how the script work can be found in the file CodeBook.md.
